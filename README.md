# mobile backend service
Web and mobile apps require a similar set of features on the backend, including push notifications, integration with social networks, and cloud storage. Each of these services has its own API that must be individually incorporated into an app, a process that can be time-consuming and complicated for app developers. this project provides the server part that forms a bridge between the frontend of an application and various cloud-based backends via a unified API and SDK

Providing a consistent way to manage backend data means that developers do not need to redevelop their own backend for each of the services that their apps need to access. potentially saving both time and money.

Although similar to other cloud-computing developer tools, such as software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and platform as a service (PaaS), this project is distinct from these other services in that it specifically addresses the cloud-computing needs of web and mobile app developers by providing a unified means of connecting their apps to cloud services.
